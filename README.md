# Spatial-Autocorrelation_eateries-in-DC
Used spatial autocorrelation techniques, including gloabl and Local Moran's I, to identify significant hotspots and coldspots of eateries. By mapping these hotspots, we gain insights into the areas where culinary diversity thrives or where gaps in food services may exist. Understanding the spatial distribution of eateries can have important implications for local government, urban planners, and entrepreneurs.
